        <p style="max-width: 450px; margin: auto; font-size: 16px; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">“Word Cairn” is a collaborative sound-poem by poet Chris Gylee and artist-musician Ruby Louise Rose. The words originate from a series of poems by Chris entitled “Songs for Our Future Selves” while sound is produced by the Damiá Modal Music Machine developed by Ruby from a set of seven distinct modal scales created by Aslan for Damiá, a constructed language spoken only by Queer people. Word combinations complement the five pentatonic and two tetratonic scales each with their own distinctive progressions of intervals and chords and evoking a particular range of emotions through the elements of air, earth, and water.</p>
        <p style="max-width: 450px; margin: auto; font-size: 12px; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">&nbsp;<br>
        Chris Gylee (he/him, Stockport, 1983) is a queer writer and artist living in rural Finland. His poems include the online collection “FORTY” and micro-chapbooks “Ten for A” and “Songs for Our Future Selves” (both Ghost City Press). Chris was long-listed for the Cúirt New Writing Prize 2023. Ruby Louise Rose is an artist who works with sound, text and performance. As a working-class autodidact and recently out trans woman, her work is an exploration of process, transformation and hidden truths. Often humorous, it playfully uses rhythm, repetition and extremes of duration to tackle ideas around desire, compassion and communication.</p>
