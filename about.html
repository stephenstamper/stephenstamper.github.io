        <h3>About</h3>
        <hr>

        <p>Ruby Louise Rose is an <a href="artist_cv_ruby_louise_rose.pdf">artist</a> who works with sound, text and performance. As a working-class autodidact and recently out trans woman, her work is an exploration of process, transformation and hidden truths. Often humorous and playful, it uses rhythm, repetition and extremes of duration to tackle ideas around desire, compassion and communication.</p>

        <p>Last year, Ruby collaborated with the Queer choreographer and dancer Beniamino Borghi on the sound and music for his “<a href="https://tanssiartesaani.com/works/nocore/nocore-encgaged/" target="_blank">NoCore: Encaged</a>” exhibition at Näsin kartano, Porvoo and Caisa, Helsinki. The exhibition showcased dance rituals designed to liberate different aspects of ourselves, such as gender and sexuality. Ruby also performed the music for a series of one-to-one workshops where participants could develop a personal dance ritual through improvisational tasks.</p>

        <p>Between 2021-2024, Ruby collaborated with the Queer choreographer and dancer Nadja Pärssinen on the sound and music for “<a href="https://npflowwow.com/let-the-wandering-talk-on-its-own-behalf/" target="_blank">Taivallus puhukoon (Let the wandering talk on its own behalf)</a>”. Taking Pärssinen’s experience of hiking the Trolltunga trail in Norway as its starting point, “Taivallus puhukoon” used movement, sound and video to explore the relationship between the female body, nature, mythology and memory. The piece was performed six times, most notably as part of “Tanssivirtaa Tampereella” at Hällä-näyttämö, Tampere in 2024.</p>

        <p>In 2023, Ruby contributed a durational piece entitled “You Suffer/NATO Phonetic Alphabet” to “<a href="https://artlanguagelocation.org/portfolio/tenth-celebrating-10-years-of-all/" target="_blank">TEN:th - Celebrating 10 years of Art Language Location</a>” at Quip & Curiosity, Cambridge. Art Language Location (ALL) is a UK-based artist-run organisation working at the intersection between art, text and place. Taking inspiration from the coded messages transmitted by Cold War numbers stations, “You Suffer/NATO Phonetic Alphabet” explored themes related to speed, technology and power. It consisted of a seemingly random collection of 10526 lower case letters, recited in the NATO phonetic alphabet over 1.316 days. Each letter was typed into a simple text document, which was then imported into an audio editor at the end of the performance. Upon playback, the performer was “rewarded” with a lo-fi 1.316-second blast of Napalm Death’s “You Suffer”: “You suffer, but why?”</p>

        <p>In 2022, alongside dancers Iiris Raipala, Kira Heinonen and Nadja Pärssinen, Ruby performed the piece “<a href="https://npflowwow.com/that/" target="_blank">THAT</a>” at Oodi, Helsinki. “THAT” was a structured improvisation based around the practice of Australian choreographer Rosalind Crisp. Responding to the performers’ movements, the sound was improvised by manipulating the audio feedback generated by the interaction between her laptop’s internal microphone, a portable speaker and the position of Ruby’s hands.</p>

        <p>Also in 2022, Ruby’s piece “<a href="https://hardreturn.bandcamp.com/album/ouroboros" target="_blank">Ouroboros</a>”—the sound of the Korg Monotron Delay’s PT2399 echo processor chip and MS-20-based low-pass filter caught in an ever-evolving feedback loop—was released under the alias A Companion of Owls by the UK-based Hard Return, a label for repetitive/persistent music.</p>
